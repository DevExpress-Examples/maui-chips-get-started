## What's in This Repository

A demo application in this repository allows you to get started with chips &#8212; controls that display information in a discrete and compact form. They allow users to make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. The following chip types are supported:
 
* [Action Chips](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Editors.Chip) are like compact buttons and allow users to invoke an action related to primary content. An action chip may be used to display documents attached to emails.
* [Filter Chips](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Editors.FilterChipGroup) allow users to select multiple options from a set. You can use filter chips to replace toggle buttons/checkboxes or use filter chips to display filters applied to content.
* [Choice Chips](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Editors.ChoiceChipGroup) allow users to select a single option from a set. These chips are best used when only one choice is possible. For example, use choice chips to select the size of an item placed in a shopping cart. Choice chips can be a good alternative to radio buttons and combo boxes.
* [Input Chips](https://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Editors.InputChipGroup) display user input as a single piece of information (may be validated, deleted, or modified). Input chips can be used to enter entities like places, activities, roles, or used to enter tags or email addresses.
